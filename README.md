# Learning Spring Boot 3.0

## Chapter 2

This chapter covers the basics of annotations used for dependency injection.
Here I learned the most basic type of injection is based on Beans. Other types of injections are based on Beans.. That's why in the first chapter I could track the bean added to the application context based on `context.getBean("nameOfBean")`


I like the fact this chapter shows how to to see videos and add others based on html and also through json.
What I don't like is going beyond with React. As for me my goal is to move business logic from the front-end to the back-end. I will concentrate in applying restful network calls and requests.

Listing all videos
```
curl localhost:8080/api/videos 
```

response:
```
[{"name":"Need HELP with your SPRING BOOT 3 App?"},{"name":"Don't do THIS to your own CODE!"}]
```

Adding a new video
```
curl -v -X POST localhost:8080/api/videos -d '{"name": "Learning Spring Boot 3"}' -H 'Content-type:application/json'
```

response
```
{"name":"Learning Spring Boot 3"}
```
